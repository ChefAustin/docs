###  What is Anka Flow?
Anka Flow is used to create and run macOS VM development environments on developer mac workstations. Anka Flow is extremely lightweight application package that gets installed as a mac application on all Macbook models and iMac. It enables iOS and macOS developers to pull macOS VMs from a central registry and run them locally. Developers can attach iOS and other devices as USB devices to macOS VMs for testing purposes.
